# gmtk23
A submission for GMTK23. Made using Bevy with egui as UI.

The code is going to be newbie Rust as a first project and on top of that a time constraint, a lot of code is extremely rushed as time was running out. It plays like a reverse tower defense game where you control the waves and the enemy builds a tower maze.
